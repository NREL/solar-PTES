LIST OF THINGS TO DO
--------------------
- Pre-define initial mass of tanks inside double_tank class and then empty them partially, during charge
- Move liquid_tanks_compute function into double_tank class, as a method
- Include "tank_stage" array inside double_tank class to store information about heat losses, etc.
- Provide all "time-variable" input parameters as arrays (including time array that determines the load and whether the cycle is a charge or a discharge cycle).
- Consider whether to move cycle position index inside fluid_class
- Think how to have components as Objects rather than functions. They would contain the "stages" information and also size, geometry, cost, etc.
- Tidy up heat exchanger function and collapse "Crat" inside "var" parameter
