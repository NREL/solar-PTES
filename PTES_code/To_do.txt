LIST OF THINGS TO DO
--------------------
- Upload Kevin code into Github
- State storage duration to compute initial mass of storage tanks.
- Finish re-implementation of "Heat engine" mode
- Think how to have components as Objects rather than functions. They would contain the "stages" information and also size, geometry, cost, etc.
- Consider whether to move cycle position index inside fluid_class
- Tidy up heat exchanger function and collapse "Crat" inside "var" parameter
