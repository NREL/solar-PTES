LIST OF THINGS TO DO
--------------------
- Eliminate PTES_WRITE subroutine and use plot_states as a method
- Tidy up heat exchanger function and collapse "Crat" inside "var" parameter. Change hex_core_q (and rest of hex_TQ_cond?) from temperature_based to enthalpy based.
- State storage duration to compute initial mass of storage tanks.
- Finish re-implementation of "Heat engine" mode.
- Think how to have components as Objects rather than functions. They would contain the "stages" information and also size, geometry, cost, etc.
